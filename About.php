		</p>
		<p class="r"> The Library is an online bookstore that started this June of 2020. Due to the <br> pandemic, many people are forced to stay at home that is why with this website, we are <br> bringing the comfort of being in the library while you are in your houses. Even though <br>this site was recently made, the physical store of The Library was established way back <br> 2019.<br>
		</p>
		<p class="r">
		This websites as the name literally implies, just like you do in the library, you <br> can borrow the books you want as long as it is within the list. You can browse from our <br> variety of books, ranging from fiction to non-fiction, from well known writers like J.K. <br>  Rowling, David Levithan, Paulo  Coelho,  and many more famous and undiscovered <br> writers. The Library doesn't do online creation of account as to ensure the realness <br> of the borrower however if you want to proceed in borrowing a book for the  next time <br> through online, you can visit the physical store first of The Library in Farmers Plaza,<br>  Cubao to begin processing your account. </p>
